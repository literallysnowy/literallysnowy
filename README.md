I'm a HTML/CSS developer passionate about crafting sleek, modern websites. ðŸš€
I organize my projects into GitHub Organizations so each site gets its own domain like:
sitename.github.io instead of literallysnowy.github.io/sitename ðŸŽ¯

To make things easier, I also repost the source files to my main profile, so you can easily access and use them!

ðŸ”¹ Always learning & improving
ðŸ”¹ Open to collaboration
ðŸ”¹ Building unique, user-friendly web experiences

Check out my work and feel free to use my projects in yours! Letâ€™s build something awesome together. ðŸ’™âœ¨
